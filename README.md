# Effects of Latitude on Climate
## 1. Background
It's too hot at the equator, should it be cooler if traveling North? Many will answer yes as a common sense; equator should be the hottest place on Earth. In this project, weather of more than 500 cities were analyzed to investigate how weather is changing with latitudes and help answer this question. All results and graphs are published online for public access through GitHub IO.
 
#### Quick Demo:

<div align="center" >
<img style="border: 2px solid black" src="./static/images/demo.gif" width=700px/>
</div>

## 2. Website Deployment:
As this is a simple website with multiple webpages, GitHub IO is chosen for simplicity. All webpages are fully functional and inter-connected where different data types can be accessed clicking at different buttons & graphs. Bootstrap grid system is ultilized to automatically reformat the contents for different screen sizes from large (TVs, big monitors, etc.) to xtra small devices (cellphones, small tablets, etc.)

## 4. Table of Contents  
* **Data:** original CSV climate data of all analyzed cities around the world.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** brought in CSV and convert to HTML table, which is used for _Data.html_.
* **static:**
  * **/css/style.css** : CSS for all webpages.
  * **images**: all pictures showing on each webpage and Readme.
* **weather-analysis:** all webpages of this project: 
  * **Cloudiness.html**: shows cloudiness vs. latitudes graphs and analysis.  
  * **Comparison.html**: shows all plotted parameters vs. latitudes for easy comparison between different categories.
  * **Data.html**: shows all raw data in an easy-to-read format.
  * **Humidity.html**: shows humidity vs. latitudes graphs and analysis.  
  * **Temperature.html**: shows temperature vs. latitudes graphs and analysis.  
  * **Windspeed.html**: shows windspeed vs. latitudes graphs and analysis. 
  * **index.html**: main webpage. 
 
*  


## Summary  
* HTML provides the skeleton to layout the web content
* BootStrap and CSS provide easy custom formats and decorations
* Project took total of ~30 hours for writting codes, researching for custom format and debugging errors
