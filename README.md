# Weather Analysis Website
## Background
Weather of more than 500 cities were analyzed to investigate how weather is changing with Latitudes. All results and graphs are published online for public access through GitHub portal. Webpage is fully functional where different data types can be accessed thru series of buttons. Custome grid is ultilized to automatically reformat the contents to fit different sceen resolutions from large (TVs, big monitors, etc.) to xtra small devices (cellphones, small tablets,etc.)

This repository contains the source codes for creating the webpage and its custom format files.
