# Effects of Latitude on Climate
## 1. Background
It's too hot at the equator, should it be cooler if traveling North? Many will answer yes as a common sense; equator should be the hottest place on Earth. In this project, weather of more than 500 cities were analyzed to investigate how weather is changing with latitudes and help answer this question. All results and graphs are published online for public access through GitHub IO.
 
#### Quick Demo:

<div align="center" >
<img style="border: 2px solid black" src="./static/images/demo.gif" width=700px/>
</div>

## 2. Website Deployment:
As this is a simple website with multiple webpages, GitHub IO is chosen for simplicity. All webpages are fully functional and inter-connected where different data types can be accessed clicking at different buttons & graphs. Bootstrap grid system is ultilized to automatically reformat the contents for different screen sizes from large (TVs, big monitors, etc.) to xtra small devices (cellphones, small tablets, etc.)

## 4. Table of Contents  
  
* **Images**: folder contains README.md background picture  
* **Resources**:  
  * *assets/images* : folder contains all images used on webpages  
  * *cities.csv* : raw data that were analyzed and processed for data analysis & visualizations  
* **Cloudiness.html** : webpage to shows cloudiness vs. latitudes graphs and analysis  
* **Comparison.html** : webpage to shows all plotted parameters vs. latitudes for easy comparison between different categories 
* **Data.html** : webpage to shows all raw data in an easy-to-read format 
* **Humidity.html** : webpage to shows humidity vs. latitudes graphs and analysis  
* **PandasToHTML.ipynb** : jupyter notebook file contains source code to convert from CSV to HTML table  
* **Temperature.html** : webpage to shows temperature vs. latitudes graphs and analysis  
* **Windspeed.html** : webpage to shows windspeed vs. latitudes graphs and analysis  
* **index.html** : main webpage  
* **style.css** : custom CSS format file for all webpages 

## Summary  
* HTML provides the skeleton to layout the web content
* BootStrap and CSS provide easy custom formats and decorations
* Project took total of ~30 hours for writting codes, researching for custom format and debugging errors
