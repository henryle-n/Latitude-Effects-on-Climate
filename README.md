# Effects of Latitude on Climate
## 1. Background
It's too hot at the equator, should it be cooler if traveling North? Many will answer yes as a common sense; equator should be the hottest place on Earth. In this project, weather of more than 500 cities were analyzed to investigate how weather is changing with latitudes and help answer this question. All results and graphs are published online for public access through GitHub IO. Webpage is fully functional where different data types can be accessed thru series of buttons. Custome grid is ultilized to automatically reformat the contents to fit different sceen resolutions from large (TVs, big monitors, etc.) to xtra small devices (cellphones, small tablets,etc.)
 
#### Quick Demo:

<div align="center" >
<img style="border: 2px solid black" src="./static/images/demo.gif" width=700px/>
</div>

## 2. Website Deployment: 
https://henryle-n.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/WebVisualizations/index.html  
  
## Tools | Languages | Techniques  
- HTML-5 | CSS-3 | BootStrap-4 | Python  
- Pandas | CSV to DataFrame | DataFrame to HTML  
- Jupyter Notebook | Google Chrome ver. 84 | Visual Studio Code | GitHub.io Web Hosting | Git Bash  
- BootStrap highlights:  
  - *NavBar* : navigation bar on top of the page  
  - *Flex Box* : builds footer to show author name and date of completion  
  - *Custom Grid* : splits webpage into well organized layout based on 12-column grid system  
  

## Table of Contents  
  
**NOTE**: The main folder contains all files is **WebVisualizations**  

### Inside this folder:
  
- **Images**: folder contains README.md background picture  
- **Resources**:  
  - *assets/images* : folder contains all images used on webpages  
  - *cities.csv* : raw data that were analyzed and processed for data analysis & visualizations  
- **Cloudiness.html** : webpage to shows cloudiness vs. latitudes graphs and analysis  
- **Comparison.html** : webpage to shows all plotted parameters vs. latitudes for easy comparison between different categories 
- **Data.html** : webpage to shows all raw data in an easy-to-read format 
- **Humidity.html** : webpage to shows humidity vs. latitudes graphs and analysis  
- **PandasToHTML.ipynb** : jupyter notebook file contains source code to convert from CSV to HTML table  
- **Temperature.html** : webpage to shows temperature vs. latitudes graphs and analysis  
- **Windspeed.html** : webpage to shows windspeed vs. latitudes graphs and analysis  
- **index.html** : main webpage  
- **style.css** : custom CSS format file for all webpages 

## Summary  
- HTML provides the skeleton to layout the web content
- BootStrap and CSS provide easy custom formats and decorations
- Project took total of ~30 hours for writting codes, researching for custom format and debugging errors
